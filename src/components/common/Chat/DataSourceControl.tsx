 * The chat toolbar's data-source chip: which dataset this build reads, and — up

 *
 * The chip is always visible, not just when it is changeable. A build's evidence
 * comes from this choice, so the transcript should say which one it was long
 * after the build is done; that is also why it goes read-only (rather than
 * disappearing) once locked.
 *
 * This is the ONLY place the dataset is chosen — starting a chat does not ask —
 * so while it is still changeable the chip is drawn as a real control rather
 * than a label, and reverts to a plain label once the build has frozen it.
 *
 * Changing is a two-step commit: pick, then confirm. The choice decides which
 * data every persona in the build is evidenced from and cannot be corrected
 * afterwards, so the dialog restates the dataset by name instead of asking a
 * bare "are you sure?".
